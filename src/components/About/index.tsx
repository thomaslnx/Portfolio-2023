            Hi, Marcos Moura here! ðŸ‘‹ I&apos;m a FullStack Software Engineer
            working mainly with JavaScript and its associated most famous
            frameworks such as ReactJS, NextJS, NodeJS, Typescript, TailwindCSS,
            Styled-Components, REST, and GraphQL APIs.
            <br/> <br/>
            I&apos;m always keeping
            in moving, learning new things, like Golang &nbsp;

            benchmarking, memory leaks, long-running processes from NodeJS, and so on.
            I&apos;ll start putting all this into practical projects, like this one to
            prove myself about what I&apos;m learning. So, stay tuned.

            As a full-stack software engineer, I was responsible for automating some
            processes, like the sending of push notifications through our mobile app
            every time one new job opportunity was included in our job board to all
            photographers that fit the job requirements. This automation makes the
            inner team save time and reach our target audience at once. For this task,
            I used technologies like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, React, NodeJS,
            Typescript, Amazon SNS Service, Amazon SQS Service, and others.

              During my time at the company, I had the opportunity to work on two projects.
              At first, I was implementing the entire layout from the design team to an inner
              project. For this, I used React, Typescript, and Styled-Components. For the
              second project, I worked as an outsource with a partner&apos;s team, where we
              were migrating the legacy frontend system to React using Typescript using the
              client&apos;s style guide.

              This training aims to make the candidate understand JS advanced concepts
              and when to use it to get all the power of JavaScript language. In this
              course, I have learned and practiced JS concepts like generators, iterators,
              async iterators, map, weak map, reflect, proxy, node timers, regex, design
              patterns like SOLID, DRY, Clean code, dependence injection, and factory among
              some others. I have dived deep into javascript testing using frameworks like
              Jest and the newest nodejs 20 native testing solution, node streams,
              graceful shutdown, performance, and a lot more. in this course, I have learned
              that I can use JS to create the most advanced solution than just a CRUD.
