            Hi, Marcos Moura here! ðŸ‘‹ A little bit about myself: I'm married to
            the most wonderful woman ever and I have two little beautiful
            princesses. I'm a Jr Javascript Full Stack developer with about 3
            years of experience, recently working mainly with ReactJS and NodeJS
            but I have some experience with React Native too. I'm always keeping
            in move, learning something new that is so new and exciting to me
            and which makes me more productive and valuable as a professional
            developer. I love coding because is there no boring routine from
            doing daily the same thing and as proof virtually every single day I
            learn or do something completely new to me.
          </p>

              As a full-stack software engineer, I was responsible to automate some
              processes like the sending of push notifications through our mobile app
              every time one new job opportunity was included on our job board to all
              photographers that fit the job requirements. This automation makes the
              inner team save time and reach our target audience at once. For this task,
              I used technologies like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, React, NodeJS,
              Typescript, Amazon SNS Service, and others.
